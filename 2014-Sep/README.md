## DESCRIPTION

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a version of the autosplom code from September 2014 and appears to be different than what's in the main repo. I do not recall how or why these are different.

Takes CSV or tab-delimited data from Excel and generates scatterplot matrix (SPLOM). View it in action at http://weiglemc.github.io/auto-splom/

Acks:  Code to determine dimensions and datatypes is from [Mr. Data Converter](http://shancarter.github.io/Mr-Data-Converter).  Code to display SPLOM based on http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3213173
